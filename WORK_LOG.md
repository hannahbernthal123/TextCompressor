| December 1  |   9:45-10am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In this class, we were first introduced to the problem set. We didn't do a ton of thinking, but there was a general consensus about finding repeating patterns as that is a key aspect of compression algorithms. Lucas had the idea of utilizing hashing in some way, however I don't think I am totally convinced on this idea because there is no room for error with collisions and because there are so many words. |
| December 2  |   2:40-3pm    |                                                                             Today in class I kept thinking about Lucas' idea of hasing. Mr. Blick pointed out that there is no way to go both ways on a normal array, so given the word value, we wouldn't be able to then find the hash (i.e. going in the reverse of the key-value pair). However, I did have the idea that if we could utilize a touple in some way maybe we could be able to access both key and value, allowing us to easily move from one to the next. I decided that I wanted to take a different approach to this, and I am going to try to do some research on the most common words in the English language and create escape characters for those. |
| December 2  |   5-5:30pm    |        Now that I am at home, I am trying to implement the stuff that I was talking about before with the escape characters. I started by researching the ten most common words in the english language as well as obsolete ASCII values. It seems that values 0-31 are pretty much obsolete, so I created escape keys for the 17 most common words and used ASCII values 1-17. However, I realized that you can't do one letter words because then it would be signaled when it's in the middle of the word. I think this could also become an issue with the two letter words or even three letter words, so I don't think this is a great solution to be honest so I stopped that and started trying to do something else. |
| December 3  |  5:30-6:30pm  |                                  After realizing the escape characters won't work well, I decided that I am going to create something that will find repeating words in the text and then create characters for that. I spent a while trying ot figure out how to do this, but I hit a lot of road blocks. I tried scanning the text repeatedly to identify repeating words and assign codes, but the algorithm I wrote became super inefficient. It kept rescanning the same sections and slowed down drastically as the text got longer. I realized I needed a more optimal approach and didn’t know how to build one yet. Honestly, I am really excited for class because I have no idea what to do on this problem set... |
| December 7  |  10-10:30am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I started working through the solution that Mr. Blick gave us in the slides. I started by going through the slides and trying to turn the psuedocode into actual code, starting with the variables and loops. I also implemented the TST class that Mr. Blick gave us and spent time understanding it. |
| December 8  | 11:40-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In class I started brainstorming the edge case that Mr. Blick introduced. I created a somewhat psuedocoded if statement in the expand function that I could edit once I made my real variables and figured out the whole compress function. The if statement checks if the slot of the map that the lookahead number corresponds to is null, and if it is, it creates a new string using the map's value at the current index and adding on the first char in that current index's value. |
| December 9  |  8:15-8:50pm  |                                                                                                                                         The first thing I did during this time was I changed the bits to be 12 instead of 8 because I think it'll prove for better compression to take bigger bit chunks therefore allowing more possible codes to be represented. I also worked on the simplest part of compress in the while loop; I wrote the lines of code that find the longest prefix from the current index, then find the code associated with that prefix, then write that code to the file. This was confusing at first, but after going through the slides a couple of times, it was relatively easy to implement. |
| December 9  |  8:50-9:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                During this chunk of time, I worked on the code that adds the new prefix to the TST while looking ahead. At first, this was challenging because it was hard to figure out what the if statement should actually be to look ahead. I thought it would just be an index check, but it turns out that I actually need to ALSO check to make sure I have room in my dicitonary (AKA the new prefix code is under 4095 in my case). |

I hope it works! |

I got tripped up on how I was reading in a certain number of bits because I thought that ints were alwasy 32 bits, but after talking to Mr. Blick, I now understand how valuable it is to have lesser bits representing the int and also how that is possible and how it saves space. Additionally, I wrote my if statement for the edge case, I think it should work, and I started on the while loop that is the bulk of the expand function. I am going to try to finish the rest tonight! |
| December 10 |   6:30-7pm    |                                                                                                                                                               I worked through expanded during this time, and after analyzing it in class, it wasn't that bad. I went through the while loop and what I got stuck on was the if statement to check if it is possible to add the lookahead string. I think what is best is checking to make sure there is space in the codes like we did in expand and then checking to make sure the lookahead code is not equal to end of file. If that is true, we know that we can continue in. Once I finished the loop, I added some comments and am now going to check its correctness. |
| December 10 |   7-7:15pm    | While debugging, I was running into issues with chars being out of bounds. I tried tweaking a few indices and other things, but couldn't figure it out, so I asked AI for help debugging because I don't know how to use the debugger in the terminal. I then saw that "String.valueOf(i)" does not work to cast the letter to its ASCII value. Instead, I need to do """ + (char) i" so I put that into the code instead. However, I am still running into the illegal 12-bit char error. After comparing compress and expand, I realized I never put the original ASCII characters into the TST! I fixed that with a simple loop, but now I am running into issues iwth my expand function so I am going to look into that. |
