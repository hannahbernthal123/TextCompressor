| December 1  |   9:45-10am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In this class, we were first introduced to the problem set. We didn't do a ton of thinking, but there was a general consensus about finding repeating patterns as that is a key aspect of compression algorithms. Lucas had the idea of utilizing hashing in some way, however I don't think I am totally convinced on this idea because there is no room for error with collisions and because there are so many words. |
| December 2  |   2:40-3pm    |                                                                      Today in class I kept thinking about Lucas' idea of hasing. Mr. Blick pointed out that there is no way to go both ways on a normal array, so given the word value, we wouldn't be able to then find the hash (i.e. going in the reverse of the key-value pair). However, I did have the idea that if we could utilize a touple in some way maybe we could be able to access both key and value, allowing us to easily move from one to the next. I decided that I wanted to take a different approach to this, and I am going to try to do some research on the most common words in the English language and create escape characters for those. |
| December 2  |   5-5:30pm    | Now that I am at home, I am trying to implement the stuff that I was talking about before with the escape characters. I started by researching the ten most common words in the english language as well as obsolete ASCII values. It seems that values 0-31 are pretty much obsolete, so I created escape keys for the 17 most common words and used ASCII values 1-17. However, I realized that you can't do one letter words because then it would be signaled when it's in the middle of the word. I think this could also become an issue with the two letter words or even three letter words, so I don't think this is a great solution to be honest so I stopped that and started trying to do something else. |
| December 3  |  5:30-6:30pm  |                           After realizing the escape characters won't work well, I decided that I am going to create something that will find repeating words in the text and then create characters for that. I spent a while trying ot figure out how to do this, but I hit a lot of road blocks. I tried scanning the text repeatedly to identify repeating words and assign codes, but the algorithm I wrote became super inefficient. It kept rescanning the same sections and slowed down drastically as the text got longer. I realized I needed a more optimal approach and didn’t know how to build one yet. Honestly, I am really excited for class because I have no idea what to do on this problem set... |
| December 7  |  10-10:30am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I started working through the solution that Mr. Blick gave us in the slides. I started by going through the slides and trying to turn the psuedocode into actual code, starting with the variables and loops. I also implemented the TST class that Mr. Blick gave us and spent time understanding it. |
| December 8  | 11:40-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In class I started brainstorming the edge case that Mr. Blick introduced. I created a somewhat psuedocoded if statement in the expand function that I could edit once I made my real variables and figured out the whole compress function. The if statement checks if the slot of the map that the lookahead number corresponds to is null, and if it is, it creates a new string using the map's value at the current index and adding on the first char in that current index's value. |
| December 9  |  8:15-8:50pm  |                                                                                                                                  The first thing I did during this time was I changed the bits to be 12 instead of 8 because I think it'll prove for better compression to take bigger bit chunks therefore allowing more possible codes to be represented. I also worked on the simplest part of compress in the while loop; I wrote the lines of code that find the longest prefix from the current index, then find the code associated with that prefix, then write that code to the file. This was confusing at first, but after going through the slides a couple of times, it was relatively easy to implement. |
| December 9  |  8:50-9:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         During this chunk of time, I worked on the code that adds the new prefix to the TST while looking ahead. At first, this was challenging because it was hard to figure out what the if statement should actually be to look ahead. I thought it would just be an index check, but it turns out that I actually need to ALSO check to make sure I have room in my dicitonary (AKA the new prefix code is under 4095 in my case). |

I hope it works! |
