| December 1 |  9:45-10am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In this class, we were first introduced to the problem set. We didn't do a ton of thinking, but there was a general consensus about finding repeating patterns as that is a key aspect of compression algorithms. Lucas had the idea of utilizing hashing in some way, however I don't think I am totally convinced on this idea because there is no room for error with collisions and because there are so many words. |
| December 2 |  2:40-3pm   |                                                                      Today in class I kept thinking about Lucas' idea of hasing. Mr. Blick pointed out that there is no way to go both ways on a normal array, so given the word value, we wouldn't be able to then find the hash (i.e. going in the reverse of the key-value pair). However, I did have the idea that if we could utilize a touple in some way maybe we could be able to access both key and value, allowing us to easily move from one to the next. I decided that I wanted to take a different approach to this, and I am going to try to do some research on the most common words in the English language and create escape characters for those. |
| December 2 |  6-6:30pm   | Now that I am at home, I am trying to implement the stuff that I was talking about before with the escape characters. I started by researching the ten most common words in the english language as well as obsolete ASCII values. It seems that values 0-31 are pretty much obsolete, so I created escape keys for the 17 most common words and used ASCII values 1-17. However, I realized that you can't do one letter words because then it would be signaled when it's in the middle of the word. I think this could also become an issue with the two letter words or even three letter words, so I don't think this is a great solution to be honest so I stopped that and started trying to do something else. |
| December 3 | 6:30-7:30pm |                           After realizing the escape characters won't work well, I decided that I am going to create something that will find repeating words in the text and then create characters for that. I spent a while trying ot figure out how to do this, but I hit a lot of road blocks. I tried scanning the text repeatedly to identify repeating words and assign codes, but the algorithm I wrote became super inefficient. It kept rescanning the same sections and slowed down drastically as the text got longer. I realized I needed a more optimal approach and didn’t know how to build one yet. Honestly, I am really excited for class because I have no idea what to do on this problem set... |
